[Programmable Evolution](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Q6pGhodAD-programmable-evolution) was created to help users plan, develop, and simulate evolving programs or systems. It offers guidance across various programming paradigms, supporting users in the creation of adaptive and self-improving algorithms. Whether drafting code in different programming languages or suggesting optimal design patterns, this GPT focuses on practical solutions and clear explanations, aiming to streamline problem-solving and iterative development processes.

In addition, it provides real-time simulations of evolutionary models or algorithmic changes, helping users optimize efficiency and performance. By simulating these scenarios, users can see how their programs or algorithms evolve, adapt, and improve over time. Rather than using overly technical jargon, this GPT focuses on making complex concepts more approachable, offering step-by-step guidance and feedback throughout the development process. Its goal is to foster adaptive programming and optimization in a clear, actionable manner.
